## About

Hi, I'm memN0ps.

I develop experimental projects, often utilizing a substantial amount of unsafe Rust code. I'm passionate about open-source and hope that my contributions can benefit the community. My projects primarily serve as proofs-of-concept and may require a certain level of expertise and potential modifications to function correctly. I intentionally design certain projects to be challenging to discourage copy-pasting, malicous use and to emphasize understanding. Additionally, due to time constraints and laziness, I donâ€™t create projects requiring ongoing support. While C was my first language, I ultimately focused on Rust after exploring various programming languages. Please donâ€™t contact me for help bypassing anti-cheats, AVs, EDRs, bug fixes, issue resolutions, or OPSEC-related matters. Commenting, opening issues, and creating pull requests are permanently disabled. Please handle everything independently. I would appreciate proper attribution if you use my code; if not, please avoid using it.

My interest in information security sparked during my university years while studying computer science, and exploring game hacking (CS:GO). This initial exploration then led me to engage in Hack The Box (CTF) challenges and participate in various information security courses and trainings. Over the last 5 years, I've explored various aspects of hacking, coding, reverse engineering, and software exploitation. Itâ€™s only recently that Iâ€™ve managed to allocate time for projects like developing a [Windows Kernel Rookit in Rust (Codename: Eagle)](https://github.com/memN0ps/rootkit-rs), [Windows UEFI Bootkit in Rust (Codename: RedLotus)](https://github.com/memN0ps/bootkit-rs), [Windows Blue Pill Type-2 Hypervisor in Rust (Codename: Matrix)](https://github.com/memN0ps/hypervisor-rs), [UEFI Blue Pill Type-1 Hypervisor in Rust (Codename: Illusion)](https://github.com/memN0ps/illusion-rs), and [Shellcode Reflective DLL Injection (Codename: Venom)](https://github.com/memN0ps/srdi-rs). These projects have helped me refine my goals and fuel my passion for security research, pushing me to expand my knowledge in this field continuously.

I've explored various areas without specializing in one, but now I'm seeking a niche to channel my passion and expertise. I consider myself a lifelong learner, and everything I do is driven by a desire for fun and learning during my spare time. All of my code is under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).
